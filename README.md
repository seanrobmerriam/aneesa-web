## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for customization)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the site
3. Edit the files to customize for your practice

### Local Development

For the best development experience, use a local server:

```bash
# Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js live-server (if installed)
npx live-server

# Using PHP (if installed)
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## ✏️ Customization Guide

### 1. Update Personal Information

Replace the placeholder content in `index.html`:

- `[Name]` → Your full name
- `[X]` → Years of experience
- `[Degree]` → Your degree/qualification
- `[University]` → Your university
- `[Professional Association]` → Your professional memberships
- `[Phone Number]` → Your contact phone
- `[Email Address]` → Your contact email
- `[Address]`, `[City, State ZIP]` → Your office address
- `[State]` → Your licensed state
- `[License Number]` → Your license number

### 2. Add Your Photo

1. Add your professional headshot to the `assets/images/` directory
2. Name it `therapist-photo.jpg` (or update the filename in `index.html`)
3. Recommended dimensions: 400x400px or similar square aspect ratio

### 3. Customize Services

Edit the services section in `index.html` to reflect your specialties:

- Individual Therapy specializations
- Couples Therapy approaches
- Family Therapy focus areas
- Any additional services you offer

### 4. Update Therapeutic Approaches

Modify the "My Therapeutic Approach" section to reflect your actual methods:

- Replace or add therapeutic approaches you use
- Update descriptions to match your practice style
- Consider adding certifications or training

### 5. Customize Colors and Styling

The website uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy color customization. In `assets/css/styles.css`, modify these variables:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2c5f5d;      /* Deep teal */
    --secondary-color: #4a9b9b;    /* Medium teal */
    --accent-color: #7bc4c4;       /* Light teal */
    --light-bg: #f8fafa;           /* Very light teal */
    /* ... other colors */
}
```

### 6. Contact Form Setup

The current contact form includes client-side validation but requires server-side processing for actual email sending. To make it functional:

1. **Option A**: Use a form service like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or ContactForm7
2. **Option B**: Set up server-side processing with your preferred backend technology
3. **Option C**: Integrate with an email service API

Example with Formspree:
```html
<form id="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```
